# Project-2-Data-Analysis-With-Python
## Analyzing the ways that CCM has spread information about itself and how it was received, and also how students have been influenced by CCM's events, whether they were attended or not. While there are a lot of insights inside the file, I've selected and summarized the most interesting to display here.
## The final cleaned CSV I work with for analysis is the 'Hear_EventsOfLiteracySurvey.csv' file.


# Insights 1:
#### The CMP 135 Computer Concepts with Applications course was most popular among all ethnicities, except those identifying their gender as 'prefer not to say'.
### The students from the CMP 126 Computer Technology and Applications course had the least amount of interest in taking another course.


# Insights 2:
### The most common way to hear about a CCM computing class was through a family friend, with 95 reports confirming that.
#### Other common ways were through a highschool teacher or counselor, with 70 and 76 reports confirming that as well.
### It seems that CCM computing courses are spread most commonly through word of mouth, person-to-person.

# Insights 3:
### The most attended event was the individual campus visit. With 30 people reported attending.
#### The other most attended events were the campus info sessions (26), the highschool info sessions (25), the open house event (24), and titans tuesday info sessions (19). Information sessions were most likely to be attended while most events overall were not attended, or they were unsure.

# Insights 4:
#### While most all of interest related reports were people saying they were mildly interested (3/5), two people who went to the open house confirmed that they were extremely interested (5/5).
#### Two extremely excited people may not seem like a lot, but it was the least common response proving anyone reporting it was significant.
#### The other most attended events only had one each who confirmed they were extremely interested (5/5), but they had more who said they were mildly interested (4/5).
#### It appears that the information sessions overall were most attended, and the people who attended them expressed more mild interest. The open house had an extra person who was extremely interested, but it lacked in people who were mildly interested.
